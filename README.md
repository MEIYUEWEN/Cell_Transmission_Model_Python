# Cell_Transmission_Model_Python
A cell transmission model based on python.

Vast majority of formula is same with the origin CTM model which is proposed by Daganzo in 1994. A difference with Daganzo's model is that density of a cell is calculated instead of number of vehicles.

This code is easy to use because it is simple and only requires pandas and numpy package, which are very common python packages.

Since simulating traffic profromance of arterial road is motivation to code CTM with python, simulation of intersection of urban traffic network may not available yet.
